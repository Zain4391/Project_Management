# Project Manager

Welcome to the Project! This README will guide you through the setup process after you fork or pull this repository.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine
- npm (Node Package Manager) installed (comes with Node.js)
- PostgreSQL or another supported database installed

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zain4391/Project_Management.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Project_Management
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Once inside the project directory, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the required packages listed in `package.json`.

### 3. Create a `.env` File

In the root of the project directory, create a `.env` file. This file will store your environment variables. Here is a template you can use:

```bash
PORT=3000
APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_PORT=5432
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration:

- `PORT`: The port your application will run on (e.g., `3000`).
- `APP_URL`: The base URL of your application (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
- `DB_PASSWORD`: The password for your database.
- `DB_PORT`: The port on which your database is running (e.g., `5432` for PostgreSQL).
- `JWT_SECRET`: A secret key for signing JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

### 4. Run the Application

Start the application using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

Your application should now be running, and you can access it via your specified `APP_URL`.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to keep your `.env` file private and do not share it publicly as it contains sensitive information.
- For additional setup instructions (like setting up a database or other services), refer to the relevant sections in the documentation or contact the project maintainer.
